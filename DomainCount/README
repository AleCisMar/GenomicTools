The run_count_domains.sh script creates a list.txt file with all possible domains present in the provided .gbk genomes and will run the perl script count_domains.pl which uses list.txt to count the number of times each domain is present in each genome. The output is the table domain_count.tsv with the genomes in columns and the domains in rows. This table is used as input for heatmap construction.
